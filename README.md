# Araba

Please visit a Heroku instance (optimised for the web, not mobile) of the site at: https://araba-app.herokuapp.com/

A Q&A site for African SME/Startup founders to get meaningful business, technical and resourcing advice from each other.Inspired by Quora.com

# Objective

To empower founders to build local information networks among their peers/colleagues, and for various entrepreneurship networks in Africa to exchange information on the web. At a later stage, the same model could then be applied to other groups such as high school students who need advice from university students/professionals etc.

# Description and features

For now, the site will have:

1. Accounts: Allow users to create an account and log in to ask questions to the networks.
2. Post list: Both logged and non-logged in users will be able to view the list of questions, answers and replies to answers.
3. Upvotes and downvotes: Logged-in users will be able to vote for the most useful questions and answers or downvote the least useful questions and answers.
4. Rankings: Questions and answers can be displayed by date posted or by most upvotes.
5. Notifications:Notify logged in users when ever someone comments on a question.
6. Mobile: A companion mobile app to go with the browser web app.

# SWOT analysis

Strengths: I will be using Meteor to rapid prototype the tool. I will also be basing the tool of of microscope, an open source micrpost Meteor app, and building on top of that.

Weaknesses: I am generalist and not a deep expert at Meteor. My full Stack-Skills come at the cost of UI/Front-End skills.

Opportunities: I am connected to a few startup/SME circles and institutions and will be able too engage and onboard some users

Threats: Meteor also does not have as many develope networks and tools as the Mongo DB Express Angular Node (MEAN)stack and might come at the cost more medium-term development flexibility relative to my skillset currently

# Timesheet log

- Version 1 (Discover Meteor Tutorial): ?

This web applicaion is built using the Meteor.js framework and has its foundation based on the microscope app from the Discover Meteor Book: https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope
